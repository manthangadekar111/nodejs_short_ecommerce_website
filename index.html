                <h3>Postman</h3>
                <p>
                    Postman is a powerful API development and testing tool used by developers to streamline the process
                    of working with APIs. It offers features such as API testing, request building, collections and
                    environments management, test automation, mock servers, documentation generation, collaboration, and
                    monitoring. With its user-friendly interface and extensive functionality, Postman simplifies API
                    testing, documentation, and collaboration, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of API
                    development workflows. <br>
                    Postman enables developers to send various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to
                    test API endpoints and verify their functionality.

                <h3>MongoDB</h3>
                <p>
                    MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing and
                    retrieving data. It uses a document-oriented model, allowing developers to store data in JSON-like
                    documents with dynamic schemas. <br>
                    Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, self-describing documents, making it easy to
                    handle and represent complex data structures.
                    MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it does not use traditional SQL for querying and
                    manipulating data. Instead, it provides a flexible query language and powerful indexing
                    capabilities.

                <h3>Node.js</h3>
                <p>
                    Node.js utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it
                    to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking the execution of other operations. This
                    asynchronous nature makes it ideal for building high-performance applications.
                    Node.js can be used for full-stack development, as it enables the development of both the server-side and client-side components of an application using JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>Node.js is cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it highly versatile and accessible.</p>
